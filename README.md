🌸 Iris Flower Classification Web App
An intelligent, visually appealing Machine Learning web application that classifies Iris flower species based on user inputs. Developed as Week 3 internship task at SystemTron, this project integrates real-time prediction, interactive dashboards, and professional UI using Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn.

📌 Project Highlights
🔍 Real-time Prediction of Iris species: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

🤖 Supports multiple ML classifiers: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost

📊 Interactive Visualizations: heatmaps, violin plots, scatter matrices, and more

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, Accuracy Comparison

🖥️ Responsive UI/UX with a sleek, modern interface

🚀 Built for education, exploration, and hands-on ML learning
