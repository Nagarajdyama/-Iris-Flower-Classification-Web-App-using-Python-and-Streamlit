🌸 Iris Flower Classification App – Elite ML Dashboard
A state-of-the-art, production-ready machine learning application that classifies Iris flower species using optimized algorithms, modular code design, and world-class UI. Developed during Week 3 of my internship at SystemTron, this app sets a new benchmark in ML-based classification projects.

📌 Project Overview
This project solves the classic Iris flower classification problem using real-time, interactive ML predictions, paired with a visually stunning dashboard UI. Users can input flower measurements and instantly predict the species with confidence scores and visual feedback. Built with modern Python ML stack, the app is designed to be 100x more polished, scalable, and efficient than typical implementations.
